<p>The children called him Pierrot from the
first. That is, of course, no proper name
for a Flemish dog, but you see Mère Marie
had come from Dinant, where almost everybody
speaks French, and she had been
taught French in school. Besides, she had
French friends in Brussels and was very fond
of everything French and warm and southern.
So she had often told the children
stories about Harlequin and Columbine and
Pierrot; and when they saw what a comical,
clumsy little fellow the puppy was, and how
much he looked as though he wore big, baggy
breeches, Henri called him &#8220;drôle Pierrot,&#8221;
and wee Lisa clapped her fat little hands and
laughed shrilly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>Jean Van Huyk had brought Pierrot home
in his arms one spring evening and had
tumbled him out upon the floor of the cottage
to startle Henri and Lisa. But they
refused to be frightened, for Henri was learning
the rules of courage and Lisa thought
at first that the puppy was a baby lamb.
Straightway she fell upon him and sought to
hug him to her plump little bosom, but Pierrot
only bit her ear and made her squeal with delight,
and then wriggled out of her arms and
hurriedly waddled over to Henri, who rolled
him over on his back and tickled his round little
stomach. Whereat Père Jean roared loudly
and old Gran&#8217;père cackled from his chair.</p>

<p>Then shaggy old Luppe, who had pulled
Mère Marie&#8217;s milk-cart for seven years,
yawned tremendously, dragged himself laboriously
to his feet, stalked over from the
doorway and sniffed at Pierrot, and then
turned back with a look of dignified boredom.
By this ceremony Pierrot was constituted
an accepted member of the household.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_012.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>It was Luppe&#8217;s advancing years, in fact,
that explained the coming of Pierrot. It
was sad to think of the day when the old
fellow would no longer be able to trot into
town with the milk and cheese, but Providence
has set narrow boundaries to a dog&#8217;s
life, and Mère Marie would soon need a
younger and stronger steed.</p>

<p>So one Sunday morning Père Jean had
bade Henri dress himself in his best clothes,
for they were to drive into Brussels to the
dog market, and half the world would be
there. The Belgians do not think it strange
to go to market on Sunday, for it is an entirely
different kind of market from those
conducted on week days, and they put on
their gay clothes and make a holiday of
it.</p>

<p>When Père Jean and Henri arrived, the
city was already alive with people and they
made a pleasant sight in the bright sunshine.
Père Jean found a place to tie his horse and
then they hastened directly to the Grande<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Place. This was a great paved square with
imposing buildings on all sides such as the
Hôtel de Ville and the Maison du Roi. There
were a great many people in the square and
they were all very lively and busy and jolly.</p>

<p>One side of the square looked like a great
garden, for here was the flower market, and
the florists vied with each other in their
displays of plants and cut flowers. It was
very beautiful, also it smelled wonderfully
sweet, so that Henri fell under a sort of
enchantment and Père Jean had to drag
him away.</p>

<p>On another side of the square were parrots
and cockatoos and canaries and birds
of all kinds in little wooden cages. Some of
the parrots were making comical efforts to
talk like people, the song birds were whistling
and trilling, and all was gay and colourful,
which delighted Henri. But they had a
bird of their own at home, and it was not
birds that Père Jean had come to see.</p>

<p>At length they came to the dog market.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Four or five hundred dogs of all ages and
sizes and colours lay dozing or stood pulling
at their leashes. There were big, strong
dogs like Luppe; alert black Schipperkes;
Brussels Griffons, with faces like those of
little bearded old men; Belgian sheep dogs
with erect, pointed ears, short-haired brown
fellows and beautiful long-haired black ones;
all sorts of dogs from Great Danes to ridiculous
little Dachshunds. There were
capable-looking work dogs; mournful-eyed
mothers; swaggering young bloods proclaiming
loudly their desire for battle; awkward,
blundering, adorable four-month-olds,
and fuzzy little babies that wabbled on their
sprawling legs as though made of jelly.
Henri saw a dozen dogs that would have
suited him perfectly, but Père Jean was
apparently more difficult to please, for he
went from group to group without making a
selection. At last he told Henri that he
could not find the sort of dog he wanted
and that it was better to go home without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
any than take one that would not turn out
well.</p>

<p>Henri looked down the row of assuredly
desirable dogs and his lip began to tremble
a little. So Père Jean, instead of taking
Henri home at once, bought some cakes for
their dinner and told him he should remain
to hear the grand concert in the afternoon,
which pleased Henri so much that he forgot
his disappointment.</p>

<p>At noon there was a great hubbub and
bustle in the Grande Place, for the market
was over and all the vendors must be out of
there at once. In the afternoon the Regimental
Band came in its wonderful uniforms
and played stirring music in the kiosk until
the shadows began to lengthen and Henri
grew very weary.</p>

<p>It had been a wonderful day and Henri
fell asleep that night with gay pictures
dancing before his eyes and music sounding
in his ears. This was happiness enough for
little Henri, but Père Jean had not found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
dog he was after. He knew the value of the
right kind of dog and he would have nothing
else.</p>

<p>So Père Jean made a journey one day to
fat Auguste Naets, the butcher of Vilvorde,
who was famous for the dogs he bred.
Auguste bragged much about these dogs.
Their blood, he said, ran away back into the
Middle Ages to the boarhounds of the Dukes
of Brabant. Matins, he called them; and
it is true that for a hundred years, when
other men had grown careless of their breeding,
Auguste&#8217;s father and grandfather and
great-grandfather had kept the breed pure,
so that when the National Federation for
the Breeding of Draft Dogs was founded a
dozen years ago they deemed the Naets strain
worthy of a certificate of merit with five red
seals attached, which Auguste proudly had
framed and hung in his shop.</p>

<p>Of the hundred thousand or more dogs
that are used in Belgium as <i>chiens de trait</i>,
none were finer than those which Père Jean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
found in the kennels of Auguste Naets.
They were large dogs, with something of the
look of the St. Bernard about them, but
with smaller heads and more lithe and rangy
bodies. In colour they were all sorts of combinations
of black, white, and tawny; Auguste
held that colour meant nothing to a
cart-dog. Their ears were long and drooping
and their tails were docked when they
were puppies to avoid interference with the
harness. They would have been handsomer
with long tails, but Auguste was breeding
for utility rather than for beauty. There
was a time when the dog-owners of Belgium
cropped their dogs&#8217; ears to make them stand
erect and pointed, but it was found that
during their steady work outdoors in winter
rain and snow beat into their ears and caused
sores and deafness, so that the practice of
depriving them of their natural protection
was abandoned.</p>

<p>Auguste&#8217;s dogs, like others of their breed,
were tireless and powerful. They could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
easily draw a load of 400 pounds, though
200 pounds was usually considered a one-dog
load. Three dogs hitched to a 400-pound
load could run with it at a steady,
rapid trot for miles without apparent weariness.</p>

<p>Père Jean loved dogs, and he could have
stayed all day with Auguste in his kennels,
but to Auguste business was business, and he
at length persuaded Père Jean to pay a good
price for a likely looking beggar from the
latest litter. That was Pierrot.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has the big feet and the large bones,&#8221;
said Auguste. &#8220;That means he will grow
large and strong and live for many years,
like my Jacques,&#8221; and he pointed to the
superb sire that headed his kennels.</p>

<p>So Père Jean took the fuzzy, awkward
little puppy back to the little tile-roofed
cottage he had built for his bride ten years
before, and where Henri and wee Lisa had
been born.</p>

<p>They were sober, industrious, thrifty folk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the Van Huyks, and prosperous among their
neighbours. In Belgium a peasant is always
a peasant, and there is a wide gulf fixed between
the rich and the poor, but Père Jean
owned his little dairy farm six miles out from
Brussels on the Waterloo Road, beyond the
Forest of Soignies, and they were very comfortable
and happy.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant country, with green
pastures and meadows, nodding wheat and
rye fields, and trim, orderly market gardens
on every hand, and with straight, smooth,
hard roads all leading to town between tall
rows of poplar trees. Père Jean tilled the
little farm and he and Gran&#8217;père milked the
cows and made the cheese, while Mère Marie
took the milk in to Brussels every morning
in big brass and copper cans which she kept
very clean and shiny.</p>

<p>Farther back from the city, where the
farms were poorer and the market not so
near, the peasants wore rough smocks and
clumsy wooden shoes and lived mostly on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
coarse rye bread and bacon and potatoes,
with milk and rice and dried herring on
Fridays. But Père Jean and Mère Marie
always wore leather shoes when they went to
town, and only the children clumped around
in yellow sabots to save their Sunday shoes,
and Gran&#8217;père because he preferred them.</p>

<p>Mère Marie was a plump, fresh-faced
young woman with a beautiful, heavy crown
of golden brown hair which was always
neatly dressed, no matter how much of a
hurry she was in. She went bareheaded,
winter and summer, except when it rained;
then she drew her shawl over her head. She
wore a trim short skirt and a clean white
apron.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_021.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>On Sundays the family went regularly to
mass, dressed in their finest clothes, and then
feasted on hare and eggs and butter and
cheese and many kinds of vegetables. In
the afternoon Père Jean took his cornet and
went to practise with the band, and sometimes
he took Henri with him. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
wonderful band, for all Belgians love to
make music, and little Henri could hardly
wait for the time when his father would teach
him to play, too. But when the band
played the martial music, ah, then little
Henri&#8217;s bosom swelled almost to bursting,
and he determined to be a soldier when he
grew up. That would be grand, indeed!
But Père Jean only smiled and told him that
being a soldier wasn&#8217;t all bands and fine
uniforms.</p>

<p>Some of the peasants used dogs to harrow
and cultivate their vegetable gardens, but
Père Jean owned a big black horse named
Medard, so that Luppe&#8217;s only duty was to
draw the milk-cart and to bark at night if
strangers approached. When Pierrot grew
old enough Luppe taught him to wake up
and bark at strange noises and to keep quiet
at other times, for a good watchdog does
not waste his breath on the moon. When
the huntsmen rode by with their <i>chiens de
chasse</i> Pierrot would become very much excited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
and wanted to follow them, but Luppe
explained to him that their vocation was a
very foolish and frivolous one, and beneath
the dignity of a <i>chien de trait</i>, though Luppe
himself would often lose his head over the
warm scent of a hare, or even of a rat or mole.</p>

<p>Old Luppe was, as you see, a very wise
and experienced dog. He knew all the roads
like a book and most of the streets of Brussels.
He knew how to bring his cart safely across
crowded thoroughfares without guidance,
and to stop without instructions before the
houses of Mère Marie&#8217;s customers in the
city. Also he knew how to pull his load
with the least possible expenditure of strength
and wind, and to lie down and rest in his harness
whenever he stopped for a minute.</p>

<p>All these things he would one day teach
to Pierrot, but meanwhile the puppy&#8217;s education
was chiefly in the fundamentals.
When Luppe was away on his business
Pierrot would romp and play for hours with
the children, and as his first teeth dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
out and his second set came, white and
strong, he learned just how hard it is fitting
to bite a soft hand or plump ankle in play or
in love. Sometimes he would follow Père
Jean and Gran&#8217;père about the farm or dairy,
and they taught him to come at a call and to
lie down and wait until he was wanted.
This was a very hard lesson to master, you
may believe. Also it was hard to learn that
Sunday shoes are not meant to be chewed
like a broth bone.</p>

<p>So Pierrot lived happily through his baby
days on the dairy farm on the Waterloo Road.
There was plenty of skim milk and other
things for him to eat, and after he had overcome
a slight predisposition to colic he began
to grow very fast. His feet persisted in
keeping ahead of him in growth, and he was
still awkward when he ran fast, but his bones
were getting big and strong and he was growing
solid and heavy. As the cold weather
came on his bark grew deeper and less
squeaky and the stiff hairs began to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
through the soft puppy coat. Pierrot was
fast growing into a fine big dog, black and
white with spots of tan above his eyes and on
his muzzle and forelegs.</p>

<p>Pierrot could not yet carry wee Lisa on his
back as old Luppe could so easily, but to
Henri he seemed large enough for anything,
and the boy was very impatient to see
Pierrot&#8217;s serious training begun. So Gran&#8217;père,
in his leisure hours, built a little toy
cart and harness for Pierrot, and he and
Henri began the lessons.</p>

<p>At first Pierrot was very unmanageable
and seemed anxious to get into the cart himself,
but after a while Gran&#8217;père made him
understand that he was to go straight ahead
when given the word and not stop until
so ordered. Finally they taught him to
turn when he felt the tug of a rein on his
collar.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_025.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>When at last Gran&#8217;père felt sure that
Pierrot had learned his lessons, Henri was
allowed to take him out upon the road with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
wee Lisa in the cart, to the huge delight of
that small, merry person.</p>

<p>One day, as they passed solemnly along the
road, Henri marching sturdily alongside and
wee Lisa sitting like a proud lady in her
carriage, they met a Belgian soldier in a queer
little bonnet and a dark blue uniform with
red stripes on his trousers. Henri saluted
as Gran&#8217;père had taught him to do, and the
soldier came to a halt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going, monsieur and
mademoiselle?&#8221; asked the soldier pleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just for a drive,&#8221; replied Henri, a little bewildered
at being thus formally addressed.</p>

<p>The grenadier, who was not much of a
talker, stood regarding them with a quizzical
smile. Then Henri plucked up courage:</p>

<p>&#8220;My father wears a blue coat with brass
buttons, too,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he a soldier?&#8221; asked the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;N-no,&#8221; replied Henri. &#8220;But he plays in
the band.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, so! And shall you play in the band<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
and wear a blue coat with brass buttons?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps. And perhaps I shall be a
grenadier or a trooper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And mademoiselle, what will then become
of her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lisa? Oh, she will marry a burgomaster,&#8221;
replied Henri; whereat the soldier
laughed heartily, for he had a simple wit, and
passed on.</p>

<p>Père Jean also laughed, in his big, hearty
way, when Henri told of the encounter, but
Gran&#8217;père shook his head and looked very
thoughtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may all be,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Who knows?&#8221;</p>

<p>And so the winter passed with many small
adventures, but on the whole tranquilly.
Pierrot&mdash;he was getting to be big Pierrot
now&mdash;was very much one of the family,
more so than Luppe had ever been. Luppe
was a fine, wise, able dog, but very businesslike
and unemotional. All the family loved
Luppe and hated to see him grow old, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
had been a faithful and willing servant, but
it was Pierrot who really found a place deep
in their hearts. There had been no children
to play with when Luppe was a puppy, and
that makes a great difference. He had early
found his allotted place between the shafts,
and his greatest joy was in the day&#8217;s work.
But Henri and wee Lisa had made a comrade
of Pierrot, and so he grew up very warm-hearted
and with a broader, deeper, more
varied outlook on life than Luppe&#8217;s. Luppe
served a kind master and mistress and was
content, but Pierrot needed love&mdash;given and
received.</p>

<p>The winter was cold and a hard one for
old Luppe, and he became a little rheumatic
and stiff in his hind legs. He accepted more
promptly every opportunity to rest, and rose
with less alacrity than of old. Père Jean and
Mère Marie both noticed this and began to
turn their thoughts toward the further training
of Pierrot.</p>

<p>When warm June weather came again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Luppe improved, but it was evident that
Pierrot must soon take his place. The youngster
was only fifteen months old, and his
body, which had grown with extraordinary
rapidity, still needed filling out, but already
he seemed nearly as big and strong as Luppe.
He had a tremendous appetite, and it seemed
to Père Jean that he should be earning his
board.</p>

<p>One day Père Jean had a heavy hogshead
in the dairy which he wished to move, and he
and Gran&#8217;père could scarcely budge it. Medard,
the horse, had been loaned to Joseph
Verbeeck, the market gardener, to help plough
a field for late cabbages. So Père Jean pried
up the hogshead with a bar while Gran&#8217;père
slipped rollers beneath it, and when Luppe
returned from town with Mère Marie they
hitched him to a chain fastened around the
hogshead. Père Jean and small Henri pushed
from behind, Gran&#8217;père stood ready with
more rollers, and Mère Marie urged Luppe
to pull. With great effort they moved the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
heavy load a few inches, and Luppe began to
pant painfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too hard for him,&#8221; said Mère Marie.
&#8220;He is no longer young. He will hurt himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Gran&#8217;père thought of young Pierrot
and sent Henri and Lisa to find him. They
hitched him to the chain beside Luppe and
Mère Marie gave the word to start.</p>

<p>Pierrot hurled himself forward mightily
and fell back upon his haunches. Old Luppe
looked at him disgustedly. That was no way
to start a load.</p>

<p>Pierrot got up again and settled forward
into his collar, his nails scratching the dairy
floor in an effort to get a foothold, and before
the rest were ready the big hogshead started
to move. Then Luppe threw his weight
forward, and Père Jean and Henri put their
shoulders to it, and the hogshead began to
gather momentum.</p>

<p>At first Pierrot pulled jerkily, with his
forefeet scratching and his tongue hanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
out; he wanted to run with it. But Luppe
growled at him and soon he settled down to
the steady pull that counts. Gran&#8217;père began
thrusting the rollers beneath the hogshead,
Mère Marie spoke shrill words of encouragement,
and foot by foot the two big
dogs dragged the ponderous load to the other
side of the dairy.</p>

<p>Pierrot was panting and his tongue was
dripping when the work was done, but he
looked up very proudly at Mère Marie, as
Gran&#8217;père unharnessed him, and wagged his
stump tail violently as she spoke the expected
word of praise. Old Luppe said nothing, but
stalked off stolidly to his piece of carpet and
lay down with a thump.</p>

<p>Then Père Jean went over to Pierrot and
felt up and down his legs and pinched his back
and shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll do,&#8221; said Père Jean. &#8220;I think you
might take him to town to-morrow with
Luppe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pierrot had grown up.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II</h2></div>


<p>Pierrot&#8217;s first trip to Brussels was filled
with wonderful experiences. Mère Marie,
very brisk and fresh-looking, routed him out
before daybreak. The polished copper cans,
filled with last night&#8217;s creamy milk, she took
from the cool water in which they stood and
wiped them carefully. Then she brought
up the low cart, with its two stout wheels and
the framework slanting out from the sides,
and set the cans in neatly with a round
cheese and a firkin of butter. Luppe came
up quietly, and Mère Marie fastened on his
girth and collar, to which the reins were
attached, and placing him between the shafts
snapped on the traces.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_032.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>All this, of course, Pierrot had observed
many times before, but he was somewhat
astonished when Mère Marie took down his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
own harness from its peg and buckled it on
him. Then she led him over beside Luppe
and hitched him outside the left-hand shaft,
snapping the traces into a ring Gran&#8217;père
had bolted to the front of the cart. It
suddenly dawned upon Pierrot that he was
to be taken out into the world, and he began
to prance and wriggle in his excitement.
Luppe turned about and nipped his ear and
told him not to be silly. Then Mère Marie
felt of all the cans to see if they were securely
placed, pinned her little shawl across her
breast, and gathered up the reins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eui, Luppe! Eui, Pierrot!&#8221; she cried, and
the dogs trotted out into the cool morning,
Mère Marie walking rapidly beside the
cart.</p>

<p>After a little while they met another
woman with a milk-cart like Mère Marie&#8217;s
coming out of a lane, and they all went along
together, Mère Marie and the woman talking
and laughing. Pierrot tried to pick an acquaintance
with the other dog, but he appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
to be a surly fellow, and Pierrot was
forced to give it up.</p>

<p>As dawn broke there appeared on the road
other people with dogs and carts&mdash;women
with milk and both men and women with
fresh vegetables and fruit. Some of the
market gardeners had larger carts with two
or even three dogs, and a few of the lazy ones
rode and nodded on their carts.</p>

<p>The Waterloo Road runs straight into the
centre of Brussels, but Mère Marie and the
other milkwomen did not take that route.
They turned off into a cross-road to the right
after a while and at length came to the broad,
paved thoroughfare known as the Avenue
Louise. The houses began to appear closer
together and there was much stir and bustle
on the road. Pierrot had never seen so
many people before, and he found it all so
interesting and exciting that it required the
combined efforts of Luppe and Mère Marie
to keep him going straight ahead.</p>

<p>It was nearly four o&#8217;clock when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
started. A little more than an hour and a
half later Pierrot found himself in the city itself,
with houses stretching continuously down
each side of the street. He might have been
frightened but for the comforting proximity
of Luppe and Mère Marie, who seemed not
at all disturbed. It was growing noisy, too,
and Pierrot was content to trot along very
peacefully with his right side touching Luppe&#8217;s
shaft.</p>

<p>Arriving at the corner of a street that
crossed the avenue, they were halted by an
officious Garde de Ville with fierce-looking
moustaches. He wore a blue uniform with a
silver band on his cap, and a terrifying sabre
hung by his side. Behind him stood a very
dejected woman with her dog and cart,
waiting until he should find time to take her
to the station. Perhaps he had found that
her milk was not fresh or had been watered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho! Sta stil!&#8221; commanded Mère Marie,
and the dogs stopped.</p>

<p>Then the officer proceeded to inspect Mère<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Marie&#8217;s cans and to test her milk. He examined
the dogs for sores and the harness to
see if it chafed, and required Mère Marie to
show him Luppe&#8217;s drinking-bowl and the
pieces of carpet for the dogs to lie on when
resting. Finding everything as it should be&mdash;for
Mère Marie was a careful milkwoman&mdash;he
bade them pass on, and by six o&#8217;clock
they were ready for business.</p>

<p>Mère Marie gave Luppe and Pierrot each
a drink of water and a piece of hard dog
cake, and after a little rest they started on
their rounds. Most of Mère Marie&#8217;s customers
were in the Quartier Louise, where
many of the English people live, and she
seemed to be very welcome here. As the sun
rose higher Pierrot found it very pleasant
standing in the shade of the big lime trees
and chestnuts of the Avenue Louise while
Mère Marie took her bright cans to the
houses. Carriages and automobiles rolled
by constantly, and pleasant people passed
along the sidewalk, forming a fascinating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
pageant for Pierrot&#8217;s entertainment. When
he became restless and felt an impulse to go
on without Mère Marie, Luppe, who lost no
opportunity to lie down and rest, firmly restrained
him. On the whole, Pierrot behaved
very well for his first lesson.</p>

<p>And then there were many, many other
dogs to be seen. It had never occurred to
Pierrot that there were so many dogs in the
world, and he was surprised not to find them
all more excited about it. Luppe apparently
paid no attention to them.</p>

<p>Most noticeable were the large carts of the
poultrymen from Malines and other outlying
villages who gathered at the covered market
in the Rue Duquesnoy. To most of these
carts five large dogs were harnessed, one
between the shafts and two on each side;
sometimes a sixth was used beneath the cart
with his tugs fastened to the axle. These
poultrymen travel in the night (Malines is
fifteen miles from Brussels) in order to be
early at market, and frequently they fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
asleep on their carts, leaving the dogs to trot
along unguided. The intelligent animals not
only keep up their steady pace without
urging, but learn to avoid all difficulties of
the road by their own initiative.</p>

<p>Then there were milkwomen and laundresses
with carts much like Mère Marie&#8217;s,
drawn by one dog or two. There were
bakers and peddlers of fruit and vegetables,
who mostly used high carts with their dogs
hitched beneath. And there were noisy,
shouting mussel vendors pushing their carts
before them, with a dog hitched ahead to
help.</p>

<p>Sometimes a poor man would pass with a
nondescript cart laden with kindling-wood,
garbage, or what-not, drawn by an undersized,
underfed mongrel who was often hard
put to it to drag his load, but for the most
part the dogs were fine, big, strapping fellows
used to their work, and apparently enjoying
it.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_038.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The dog, as a matter of fact, is not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
man&#8217;s closest four-footed friend, but when
set to work is his most willing slave and
helper. He is often intractable, but when he
works at all he works with a will. Other
animals that have been harnessed and
trained to do man&#8217;s work&mdash;horse, elephant,
camel, mule, burro, ox, or reindeer&mdash;labour
for the most part with a sort of stolid indifference
and resignation. With the exception
of the most intelligent elephants and
horses, the dog is the only quadruped who
displays a genuine interest and joy in his
work. Whether hauling a canal boat in
France or a sled in Alaska, he puts his heart
and brain into his task and works like a man.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_039.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>It did not occur to either Pierrot or Luppe
to question the justice of their position.
Luppe, in fact, was happiest when between
the shafts. And the whole discussion as to
whether or not the <i>chiens de trait</i> are cruelly
treated is more or less profitless, as it all
depends on the master. Some of the owners
are undoubtedly cruel, and very few of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
have any real feeling for their dogs, but for
the most part common sense demands good
treatment; the owner is a fool who destroys
the value of his own property by overwork
or underfeeding, and for the most part the
dogs are well fed and are kept in fine fettle
for their work.</p>

<p>Belgium has been slow to enact prohibitory
laws in these matters, but of late years a
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
has been active, and in some of the cities
one may occasionally observe placards reading,
&#8220;<i>Traitez les animaux avec douceur</i>.&#8221; And
for some years past there has been, in Brussels
at least, police inspection of harness to see that
it does not chafe the dogs, and drivers of sore,
sick, or lame dogs are at least warned.</p>

<p>Before noon Mère Marie had visited all
her customers and sold all her milk, and
Luppe knew when the route was completed
and exhibited a growing interest in the prospect
of home and dinner.</p>

<p>As they clattered across the Grande Place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
they found many of the poultrymen also
making ready for departure. Across the
square a cry would be heard, &#8220;Eui, Vos! Eui,
Sus!&#8221; And off would rattle another team on
the road to Malines.</p>

<p>Pierrot was very weary when they reached
home again, due to the excitement of new experiences
as much as to the work done. He
was very glad to curl up on his bed and dream
of carts and dogs and people and rows of
houses, and Mère Marie bade the children
not to disturb him.</p>

<p>The next day Pierrot remained at home,
but the day following he travelled again to
Brussels with Mère Marie and Luppe, and
thereafter for many days. Little by little
Mère Marie and Luppe taught him the things
a cart-dog should know, and gradually he
ceased to be astonished and excited by the
sights and noises and smells of the city, and
when he reached home he was not so weary.</p>

<p>There came a day when old Luppe was
evidently ailing, and Père Jean thought it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
would be a good time to try Pierrot alone
with the cart. So the next morning Mère
Marie awoke Henri very early and they
hitched Pierrot in Luppe&#8217;s place between the
shafts. Henri was to go along with Mère
Marie to see that Pierrot did not run away
while she was visiting her customers.</p>

<p>Old Luppe arose stiffly and shakily and
came over to be harnessed as usual. Mère
Marie pushed him gently aside, and Luppe
stood for a moment looking surprised and
hurt. Then his resentment against the
usurper suddenly arose and he leaped at
Pierrot&#8217;s throat.</p>

<p>Pierrot had never been in a fight before,
but he was strong and active, and instinct
told him how to defend himself. He shook
Luppe off and then the two dogs grappled.
Pierrot was hampered by shafts and harness,
but he held his own and did not attempt the
aggressive. Mère Marie sent Henri running
for his father, and seizing a milk-yoke tried to
separate the two dogs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>Both were bleeding about the mouth but
were not seriously injured when Père Jean
arrived on the scene. Mère Marie held Pierrot
by his harness while Père Jean managed
to drag Luppe off and tie him, snarling and
scolding, in the dairy.</p>

<p>Then Mère Marie made haste to load her
cart, and soon they started out upon the road.
At the sound of the departing wheels Luppe
set up a long, despairing howl. Pierrot trotted
proudly along, affecting not to hear, but
a great sadness welled up in Henri&#8217;s breast,
and there were tears in the bright eyes of
Mère Marie.</p>

<p>The journey to Brussels seemed very long
and tiresome to Henri, but he trudged along
manfully beside his mother, who sought to
keep up his spirits with cheery talk about the
city and the people there.</p>

<p>Henri had driven to Brussels several times
with his father, but he had never before
spent so much time in the streets, and he soon
forgot his weariness in the interesting sights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
about him. For one thing, he noticed that
many of the other dogs wore muzzles, and he
asked his mother about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is because they are ugly,&#8221; said Mère
Marie. &#8220;They snap at people who disturb
them and they try to fight other dogs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Pierrot wears no muzzle,&#8221; said
Henri.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is because he is gentle,&#8221; said Mère
Marie. &#8220;If you make a friend of your dog,
and never beat him except when he is very
bad, and talk to him a great deal, he becomes
very like a person and does not want to bite
any one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Belgian cart-dogs are naturally good-natured,
but their life has made them
generally combative. When their masters
take the trouble to treat them as comrades
from puppyhood, they become exceedingly
devoted and affectionate. Such a dog was
Pierrot. He did not know what it was to
have an enemy, and his love for Père Jean
and Mère Marie and Gran&#8217;père and Henri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and wee Lisa had grown as naturally as his
big muscles and rough coat.</p>

<p>Toward the middle of the forenoon Henri
grew weary again and began sitting on the
curb beside Pierrot whenever his mother left
him. So Mère Marie decided that he needed
a little diversion.</p>

<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; said she, &#8220;here are <i>mes amies, les
petites marchandes de journaux</i>. You will
make friends with them while Pierrot and I
visit Madame Courtois. It is a quiet street
and Pierrot will not run away. We will soon
return.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a little round stall at the corner sat two
pretty young girls sewing and chatting together
behind their piles of magazines and
newspapers. They looked up with smiles
and greeted Mère Marie gayly as she approached.
They, too, were from the South
and spoke French rather than Flemish.
Henri liked them at once.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_045.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;This is my little Henri,&#8221; said Mère Marie
to the newsgirls, &#8220;and his legs have become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
fatigued. May he sit with you while I visit
Madame Courtois?&#8221;</p>

<p>Both girls laughed merrily at nothing at
all and made a place for Henri on the narrow
bench between them, while Mère Marie and
Pierrot started up a side street. One of the
girls had dimples in her cheeks and the
other had curly hair which blew about her
ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the old dog to-day?&#8221; asked one
of the girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is ill,&#8221; replied Henri.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the young dog has learned to take
his place?&#8221;</p>

<p>Henri nodded very solemnly. &#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;we have taught him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereat both girls laughed again.</p>

<p>Soon they were all very good friends and
Henri was telling them all about Luppe and
Pierrot and Medard and Lisa and Gran&#8217;père
and the yellow bird in its wooden cage.
When Mère Marie and Pierrot returned,
Henri was feeling much rested but rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
hungry, and one of the girls gave him a pear
from her basket.</p>

<p>Henri turned and waved his hand to them
as Mère Marie led him away, and the girls
laughed and shouted after them: &#8220;<i>Au revoir</i>,
Mère Marie! <i>Au revoir</i>, Henri! <i>Au revoir,
Monsieur le Chien!</i>&#8221; And Henri laughed,
too, for that was a very droll way to address
Pierrot.</p>

<p>The cart was lighter going home, so Mère
Marie allowed Henri to ride part of the way,
and Pierrot trotted or walked steadily along
like the willing worker he was getting to be.</p>

<p>That day Luppe was better, but Père Jean
thought he had best have a good rest; so he
was given a comfortable bed of straw in an
unused stall in the little thatched stable, and
Mère Marie and Henri and Pierrot went
again to the city without him. And again
Luppe howled at their departure and was
very despondent all day.</p>

<p>One cannot say whether Luppe died of a
broken heart or whether it was his advancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
years and the rheumatism. Père Jean
did not realize what it meant to Luppe to be
deprived of his work in life; and, anyway,
what else could he have done? The poor old
dog failed rapidly. He would not eat, and he
scarcely responded to the attentions which
the whole family showered upon him. Only
on the last day his eyes followed Gran&#8217;père
about with dumb pleading in them; and when
Gran&#8217;père at last knelt beside him, Luppe
painfully dragged himself up into the old
man&#8217;s arms, and, with a great sigh, died.</p>

<p>Mère Marie and Henri and Lisa all wept,
Lisa the loudest, and Gran&#8217;père and Père
Jean were both very quiet and sober. It is
not fitting that a man should mourn a dog as
he mourns a brother or even a cross old uncle,
but sometimes a dying dog leaves just as
deep a feeling of loss. Luppe, with all his
little faults, had been one of the family for so
long that home would never seem quite the
same again without him.</p>

<p>They buried him under the grapevine, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
sheltered spot, and many a human grave has
been watered by less genuine tears. Then
Lisa brought blue cornflowers and red poppies
and laid them on the little mound, and they
all went silently back to the house.</p>

<p>Thus was old Luppe gathered to his fathers
and young Pierrot reigned in his stead.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_049.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">III</h2></div>


<p>It was not long after old Luppe&#8217;s death
that a terrible thing happened. Père Jean
came in one afternoon with a piece of yellow
paper which he and Mère Marie and Gran&#8217;père
studied very gravely for a long time.
The children were sent to bed early but
they could hear their elders talking until
very late. They could not imagine what
it meant, but when Henri woke up once
in the night he heard Mère Marie weeping,
which was strange, for she was usually so
cheerful. Perhaps she was thinking about
Luppe.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_050.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>In Brussels there seemed to be more excitement
than usual, and nearly every one
bought papers of the pretty newsgirls at the
corner. All were serious looking and many
appeared to be frightened. Also there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
soldiers marching through the streets, which
was a grand sight to Henri.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_051.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>It was from the newsgirls that Henri at
last learned what it was all about. It was
war, which of course explained the soldiers.
Henri&#8217;s heart leaped as he watched them in
the hope that he might see some fighting, but
he was a little frightened, too. On the way
home he plied his mother with questions, but
she was very quiet and he did not learn much
from her.</p>



<p>At last he found out that Père Jean, who
had once served a term in the army, had been
called to the colours and attached to a
company of reserves. Every day he had to
leave the farm and the dairy in Gran&#8217;père&#8217;s
hands and go away to drill. On these occasions
he wore a uniform which, while not
quite so gay as the one he wore in the band,
was more martial looking. This made Henri
very proud, but Mère Marie had not much to
say about it.</p>



<p>Once, when Henri stayed at home to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Gran&#8217;père, they heard a great sound of
tramping and went out to see what it was.
Up the road a cloud of dust appeared and
through it the legs of many men all moving
together and the glint of sun on steel.
Presently the soldiers came, hundreds and
hundreds of them, marching past the little
dairy farm toward Brussels. Henri wanted to
cheer, but Gran&#8217;père seemed so stern that he
refrained. Together they stood beside the
road, old man and little boy, very straight
and rigid, saluting solemnly as the officers
rode past. It was all most impressive.</p>

<p>Henri continued to go to the city
frequently with Mère Marie, not because
Pierrot was likely to misbehave, for he had
learned his lessons well, but because Mère
Marie more and more wanted him with her.
Everywhere he heard talk of the great war
and learned to keep his ears open. The Germans
had come and there was fighting at
Liège&mdash;though Henri did not in the least
know where Liège might be. Every one was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
proud of the brave men who were holding the
forts, and Henri could understand something
of that. He was proud, too, especially as
his father was a soldier, though he did not
understand why Père Jean had not been fighting
and winning battles. Wounded men
were occasionally brought in to Brussels,
and Mère Marie seemed much troubled by
the sight of them. Henri wanted very much
to question them about fighting but was
given no opportunity.</p>

<p>Then came the day when the terrible news
that Liège had fallen sent Brussels into a
fever of excitement. Some of Mère Marie&#8217;s
customers packed up and moved away to
Antwerp or Ostend or England, so that
Pierrot&#8217;s route grew shorter. There seemed
to be fear that the Germans might appear at
any moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;The French!&#8221; cried the people in despair.
&#8220;Where are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>When Mère Marie and Henri reached
home that day Père Jean was waiting nervously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
in his uniform, with his rifle and accoutrements
ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have been called to the front,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;The Germans must be kept from
Brussels.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not much more was said; it was not a
time for talking. Père Jean kissed them all,
even old Gran&#8217;père, and said good-bye, and
hurried off down the road. Mère Marie was
very brave and did not weep till he had gone.
Then she pressed Henri and wee Lisa close to
her and sobbed bitterly, which made the
children cry, too, and Pierrot, who had not
been unharnessed, came dragging his cart and
thrust his moist nose among them in sympathy.
But Gran&#8217;père stood alone by the
road, looking toward Brussels, his shoulders
squared and his lips closed in a thin line.</p>

<p>Then terrible events took place very
rapidly: The Belgians could not hold back
the Germans and Père Jean and the rest
were forced to fall back to Antwerp. The
Gardes de Ville in Brussels advised Mère<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Marie not to come to town any more, so they
said good-bye to the pretty newsgirls and
their other friends and tried to explain the
matter to Pierrot who complained the next
morning because he was not harnessed to his
cart.</p>

<p>That is why they were not in town when
the news came that Louvain had been destroyed
and many peaceful people who were
not soldiers at all had been shot. But the
news was not long in reaching the dairy farm,
and Mère Marie turned very white. Some
of their neighbours packed up their belongings
and drove away, but Gran&#8217;père and Mère
Marie did not know where to go, so they
stayed at home.</p>

<p>Three Belgian soldiers came and drove off
Medard and all the cows except one spotted
heifer, and gave Mère Marie a receipt, saying
that she would be paid some time. They all
knew the Germans would soon be there, so it
didn&#8217;t matter much; and with only one cow
to milk and no trip to make to town there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
was less work to do. Gran&#8217;père, with the
help of Mère Marie and Henri and Pierrot,
began to harvest such of their small crops as
he could.</p>

<p>On August 18th a frightened neighbour
brought word that the King had left for Antwerp
and that Brussels was in the hands of
the Germans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why cannot we go to Antwerp, <i>lieve
moeder</i>,&#8221; asked Henri, &#8220;and be with the King
and Père Jean and the soldiers?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mère Marie only shook her head; she
could not speak.</p>

<p>Of all this Pierrot understood but little.
He only knew that he missed the pleasant
clatter of the milk-cart at his heels, and the
shade of the lime trees on the Avenue Louise,
and all the interesting sounds and smells of
the city, and the sweet laughter of <i>les petites
marchandes de journaux</i>. Also he missed the
strong, kind hands and deep voice of Père
Jean. But he, too, was soon to learn something
of the meaning of war.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>A few years before a regiment of <i>carabiniers</i>
had started to use dogs to haul small supply
carts and <i>mitrailleuses</i> or machine-guns.
They are the soldiers who wear dark green
uniforms with narrow yellow braid and
yellow badges, wide-collared overcoats in
winter, and queer, high-crowned hats with
chin straps and plumes of glossy, green-black
cock feathers sprouting from green and yellow
rosettes. That is, of course, the parade hat.
In action they wear little round caps or take
the feathers out of their hats and cover them
with black oilcloth. The experiment with dogs
proved successful, and now that there seemed
a prospect of much fighting and marching in
the rough country the army decided to extend
this branch of the service and began to
commandeer hundreds of strong, well-trained
<i>chiens de trait</i>.</p>

<p>Just before the first Uhlan appeared at the
Van Huyk farm a Belgian carbineer came
very hurriedly one morning and led Pierrot
away. The dog resisted at first but soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
found he had got to go and trotted off up
the road by the soldier&#8217;s side. The children
clung to his rough neck and wept until Mère
Marie dragged them into the house, but
Gran&#8217;père stood very straight and still and
put his hand to his forehead when the soldier
and Pierrot marched away. The last thing
Pierrot saw as he turned back at the bend in
the road was the stiff, brave figure of the old
man standing before the little farmhouse, and
the last thing he heard was the wild wailing
of wee Lisa who could not understand and
would not be comforted.</p>

<p>Pierrot and the carbineer were soon joined
by other soldiers with other dogs, and they
all hurried along the strange roads together.
It was a long journey, more than twenty
miles, for they made a wide detour around
Brussels, passing north through Anderlecht.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_058.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>When they arrived at last at Malines
Pierrot was placed in an enclosure with many
other dogs. They were not used to being
together in this way, and two men had to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
about among them with whips to keep them
from fighting. But Pierrot, who was always
friendly, found this contact with his kind
rather pleasant, though he was greatly perplexed
by it all and wanted to go home.</p>

<p>At night the dogs were fed and given straw
to lie upon, but none of them slept well in the
new surroundings, and their guards were tired
and irritable before morning.</p>

<p>After daybreak soldiers came and took out
the dogs two by two. Finally a big, bearded
carbineer named Conrad Orts approached
Pierrot. He patted Pierrot&#8217;s head, opened
his mouth to look at his teeth, and ran his
hand down the hairy back and legs, as Père
Jean used to do, and Pierrot liked him. Also
he seemed to like Pierrot, for he smiled, and
said, &#8220;<i>Un bon garçon</i>.&#8221; Then he selected a
big, strong, surly looking dog named Jef, so
Pierrot afterward learned, and led the two
dogs on leashes out into an open field where
there were tents and carts and piles of boxes
and bundles and much bustling about.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>They came to a strange little cart the like
of which Pierrot had never seen before. It
was a rapid-fire machine-gun mounted on
two bicycle wheels. In place of shafts there
was a single tongue with two collars fastened
at the end, one on each side. One of these
Conrad snapped about Pierrot&#8217;s neck and
the other about Jef&#8217;s, and then fastened the
traces. Then he trotted them about for a
few moments till he seemed satisfied. The
gun and carriage weighed less than 200
pounds altogether, which was a very easy
load for two strong dogs on level ground.
Other dogs were being harnessed to similar
vehicles, only some of them had ammunition
boxes in place of the little cannon. Then
Conrad tied the dogs and went in search of the
two soldiers who had brought them, in order
that he might learn their names, which was a
wise thing for him to do.</p>

<p>For a day or two Conrad Orts spent much
time training Jef and Pierrot, taking them
through water and over all kinds of rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
country that they might be ready for anything.
Commands in the Belgian army are
given mostly in French, which was strange to
Pierrot, for Gran&#8217;père and Père Jean had
taught him Flemish words. So he had to
learn the meaning of such commands as
&#8220;Halte-là!&#8221; &#8220;Marche!&#8221; and &#8220;Va vite!&#8221; But
he and Jef soon learned to obey Conrad even
when he did not hold the reins, pulling the
little cannon with a will across creeks and up
and down steep banks, and dashing with it
through thickets where neither horses nor
automobiles could have gone. The dogs soon
discovered each other&#8217;s ways and learned to
save their strength for the hard places and
to pull well together. And in spite of Jef&#8217;s
taciturnity, Pierrot found him to be an honest
fellow, always ready to do his share of the
work, and he came to like him. Conrad
seemed much pleased with them both.</p>

<p>Then came a morning when there was
great excitement in the camp of the carbineers.
Men were running all about and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
officers were shouting commands. Conrad
came and hurriedly harnessed Pierrot and
Jef to their carriage and they started off on a
run down the road toward Brussels with
some of the other dogs and guns. When
they had gone about a mile the dogs were unharnessed
and tied to trees, and the guns
were placed in the road. Presently the
galloping of horses was heard and shots were
fired, which frightened the dogs and made
them try to break loose. But they were
much more frightened when their own guns
began to speak. A horrible din arose, and
some of the dogs lay down and cowered and
others pranced and howled. Men came and
kicked them and told them to be still; all
of the soldiers seemed hurried and excited.
Pierrot was trembling Violently and wished
he were at home with Gran&#8217;père and wee Lisa,
but stolid Jef took it all very calmly and that
put courage into Pierrot.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_062.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>A company of Belgian infantry came
running up, and throwing themselves flat on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the ground by the roadside, or standing
behind trees, they began firing at the Uhlans.
Then, after a little, two armoured automobiles
came rushing along and charged down the
road, and the firing of the machine-guns
ceased.</p>

<p>By and by the order came for the carbineers
to fall back, and the dogs were
quickly harnessed up again. Some of them
had to be kicked and cuffed into action, but
Pierrot and Jef obeyed Conrad Orts in spite
of their fear. Beside their gun a soldier lay
moaning, and Pierrot sniffed at him curiously.
He could not understand any of it.</p>

<p>It had been only a little outpost skirmish,
but it was Pierrot&#8217;s first taste of war.</p>

<p>There followed many days of this sort of
thing. Sometimes there were skirmishes,
sometimes false alarms, but the dogs never
knew when they might be called upon to
run into action with their little cannon.
Day or night, it was always the same, and it
was fortunate for them that they learned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
snatch such moments for rest and sleep
as were offered. And dinner-time became
a very irregular affair. It was all quite
different from the orderly course of a cart-dog&#8217;s
life in Brussels. But gradually they
learned to know what was expected of them
and responded willingly. In fact, there was
an excitement about it which kept them constantly
keyed up and eager. They got used
to the smell of powder and the sound of firing,
too, and Pierrot did not tremble any
more.</p>

<p>In the main, Conrad was kind, though
frequently hurried and a little rough, and
there were never sweetmeats any more nor
caresses. It was all very hard to understand.</p>

<p>Two or three times the camp was moved,
and finally they withdrew to the circle of the
Antwerp forts. And then once more Pierrot
heard the sounds and sniffed the smells of a
city. Conrad hitched his dogs one day to a
supply cart and took them in to town. Here
again Pierrot trotted along paved streets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
between high buildings, and once his sharp
ear caught the sound of milk cans rattling
over paving stones. It made him feel very
homesick.</p>

<p>On their way back they had to wait for a
long column of soldiers to march past. They
looked tired and dusty, and the tramp,
tramp of their feet sounded strange in Pierrot&#8217;s
ears. Suddenly his eye was caught by
a face he thought he knew. Could it be Père
Jean? Perhaps he had come to take him
home.</p>

<p>Pierrot sniffed, but in the strong man-smell
of the marching troops he detected no
familiar scent. He barked with all his
might, &#8220;Here I am, Père Jean; here I am!&#8221;
But Conrad bade him be still, and the soldier
in the line kept his eyes fixed sternly ahead
and marched on without turning. So Pierrot
must have been mistaken. It made him
very unhappy, and he whined in a low,
whistling tone till the column passed and
Conrad started on again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>There came a day when a fiercer battle
took place than any Pierrot had yet been
engaged in. The Germans had spread out
their forces until they were very near to the
Antwerp forts, and there was need of an
action in force to drive them back again.
Many soldiers were ordered hastily to the
front&mdash;galloping dragoons, close ranks of infantry,
and horse-drawn field guns. When
the command came to the carbineers, the
machine-gun battery was ready and the dogs
waiting in their harnesses, and they started
off at a run down the road.</p>

<p>After they had gone about a mile an officer
came galloping up and sent them off to the
left around a little wood, in which a battalion
of infantry was in action. The rattle of their
rifles made an incessant din, and now and
then shrapnel shrieked overhead and shells
exploded in the soft earth or among the trees.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_066.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The men urged their dogs to greater efforts,
and they tore over the rough ground, dragging
their guns and wagons in and out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
gullies and through underbrush at a mad
pace.</p>

<p>As they skirted the wood they came into
full view of a gray German column making
its way slowly around the flank of the
Belgians. The carbineers quickly deployed,
falling on their faces behind any bush or
hillock they could find, and opened fire. But
the men in charge of the batteries could not
hide. They must get their guns into action
and take their chances.</p>

<p>There was no time to unharness the dogs,
so they were turned about and were obliged
to stand facing away from the tumult of
battle as the machine-guns began to rattle
directly behind them. It was very hard to
bear, and some of them might have broken
and run but for a half-dozen men who had
been told off to squat by the dogs&#8217; heads and
hold them steady.</p>

<p>Bullets began to whistle about their ears
and to go plop! plop! into the ground about
them. Now and then a man fell silently or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
with a sharp cry, and over on the right Pierrot
heard a dog&#8217;s sharp yelp of anguish. Behind
him Conrad Orts grunted and breathed
through his teeth as he desperately worked
his gun.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the men at the dogs&#8217;
heads grasped his throat, uttered a rattling
moan, and fell over in the grass, and two of
the dogs started wildly off, their gun bumping
and careening behind them. Other dogs
reared and snarled, and it was all the men
could do to prevent a stampede. A panic
seized Pierrot and the desire for swift flight,
but Conrad turned about for a moment,
crying, &#8220;Steady, boys, steady!&#8221; Stolid old
Jef growled in his throat and Pierrot stood
firm.</p>

<p>The fire of the machine-guns had checked
the advancing Germans, and the carbineers
began to dart ahead from hillock to hillock,
continuing their fire. At length the Germans
withdrew and the battle centre shifted.
The carbineers were recalled and fell in with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
their battery behind the trees to catch their
breath. Just as they were turning a speeding
bullet caught a spotted young dog that
Pierrot had become acquainted with. He
was trotting close by with his mate and their
gun, and with a cry of pain and terror he
leaped into the air and fell at Pierrot&#8217;s feet,
the red blood spurting from his shoulder.</p>

<p>In terrified amazement Pierrot stopped
short and sniffed at his fallen comrade. Then
Conrad urged him on again while the men cut
the dead dog from the traces.</p>

<p>For the carbineers the battle was over for
that day, but Pierrot had looked upon his
dead and he began to understand.</p>

<hr class="chap" />






<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">IV</h2></div>


<p>At length came the day of the evacuation
of Antwerp, and the Belgian king and his
brave but beaten army moved sorrowfully
westward, leaving their fair land to suffer
unprotected. The carbineers were sent on
ahead with their battery, leaving the horse
artillery and armoured motor cars and
cavalry to cover the army&#8217;s retreat. Some of
the troops went on railway trains through
Ghent, Bruges, and Ostend, but for the most
part the army, including the carbineers, was
obliged to travel on foot.</p>

<p>It was a forced march, long and arduous.
Seventy miles they covered in three days,
sometimes keeping to the roads, sometimes
cutting across country, but always hurrying
on until it seemed to the dogs as though their
legs would collapse and their lungs burst.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>Once they came out upon the seashore,
and Pierrot would have liked to tarry here
and contemplate the new wonder, but always
there seemed to be the need for haste and
Conrad would not let him rest. They left
behind them the pleasant farms and the
wooded country and came at length to the
land of canals and dykes and sand dunes,
with queer, pollarded willows along the roadsides
and canal banks. Also there was a great
deal of rain and mud which made the hauling
of the guns doubly difficult.</p>

<p>At last, weary and wretched, they came to
a halt, and the dogs were allowed a brief rest
while the ranks were reformed and the men
established camps and dug trenches.</p>

<p>It was here that Pierrot occasionally saw
soldiers in brown khaki who sang wild songs
and spoke in a strange tongue but who seemed
very friendly. A few of them came one day
to visit the carbineers, and there was much
handshaking and smoking, but very little
conversation. They seemed particularly interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
in the dogs, and one of them, a short,
stocky fellow, with a very red face and a wide
grin, strode among them as though he had
been waiting for weeks to rub his hand up
and down a dog&#8217;s back and pinch a dog&#8217;s
ears. Jef remained coldly suspicious, but
Pierrot wagged his stump tail violently and
placed his muddy forepaws on the soldier&#8217;s
broad chest. Whereupon the soldier gave
Pierrot a stifling hug and a pat on the head
and walked quickly away.</p>

<p>This did Pierrot a world of good, for
though Conrad Orts was a good master he
seemed to have no time for caresses, and in
Pierrot&#8217;s heart there was a mighty craving for
the love of man. When the brown khaki
man was gone Pierrot stood looking after him
and whining. Then he lay down, whimpering
a little, and the great wave of homesickness
swept over him afresh.</p>

<p>If a dog cannot fully reason, he can at least
remember, and Pierrot felt that he had lost
what was best in life and he could not understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
why. He saw it all again&mdash;the peaceful
dairy farm with Medard and the cows;
Mère Marie, with her fresh face and the
shiny milk cans; the busy city and the laughing
newsgirls; mild old Gran&#8217;père and merry
little Lisa; the gentle hands and voices and
the joy of being loved. But of course Pierrot
was only a dog and war is war. One cannot
be bothered with such trivial matters when
the fate of dynasties is at stake.</p>

<p>Soon the fighting began again, only now
there were no gallant dashes along hard roads
or across green fields, but weary plodding
through the mud, climbing in and out of
trenches, short, heartbreaking charges, and
hasty retreats. It was close-range fighting,
and almost continuous. There was a constant
roaring of big guns and the sickening
bursting of bombs near at hand. The dogs
were seldom unharnessed, slept by snatches
when they could, and were often obliged to
go hungry.</p>

<p>During one of the many encounters, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
miserable little affair among the dunes ungilded
by any of the fabled glory of battle,
Conrad Orts suddenly tumbled over in the
wet sand and lay still. The order to retreat
was given, but no word came from Conrad.
Jef and Pierrot stood perplexedly watching
the other men and dogs flounder back around
the sand-hills. Then came shouts and the
sound of running feet behind them, and of
hostile firing. Turning about, they saw the
men in gray coming on, rushing from dune
to dune. Partly through fear and partly
through an instinctive feeling that they should
return to their friends, the two Belgian dogs
started off on a mad gallop after the retreating
carbineers, leaving the silent form of their
master where it had fallen.</p>

<p>By a miracle they reached the trenches in
safety, though a rain of bullets fell all about
them, and a man named André Wyns took
charge of them and their gun.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_074.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>And now a new burden was laid upon Jef
and Pierrot, for André was a rough man and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
knew little about the handling of dogs. He
beat and prodded and kicked them, not in
anger but in the mistaken belief that such
treatment was necessary to get the most out
of them. At first Pierrot was terrified and
enraged and showed his resentment, for he
had never been beaten in this manner before;
but he soon learned the uselessness of rebellion
and submitted with what grace he
could. Eagerly he waited for the coming
again of Conrad Orts, but Conrad never returned.
As for Jef, he bore it all in sullen
silence, but it was plain to be seen that he
bore no love for André.</p>

<p>When the cold winter weather came there
was added misery for dogs and men. Icy
water stood in the bottoms of the trenches
and the nights were raw and chill. It was fortunate
for Pierrot that he had always been
an outdoor dog, used to rain and frost and
sleet, and that his rough coat was thick and
matted. But that did not save his feet from
getting frost-bitten after his runs through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the water, and cut by the frozen mud and
ice-crusted pools. Little balls of ice would
form between his toes, which hurt him
cruelly. Some of the men bandaged the feet
of their dogs, but André Wyns seemed to
have no time for that. He only beat them
the harder when they started out stiffly or
showed signs of weariness on the return. At
night the men drew blankets around them
and huddled about such small fires as they
could find fuel for, but there were neither
fires nor blankets for the dogs.</p>

<p>If Czar and Kaiser can bring such suffering
to men, what chance that they will heed the
aching limbs and bleeding feet of shivering
dumb brutes?</p>

<p>The days and weeks slipped by and some
of the dogs died of pneumonia, or, weakened
by hunger and exposure, had to be shot.
Pierrot, grown gaunt and haggard, was nearing
the end of his strength. He had become
almost insensible to Andre&#8217;s beatings, and
his mind had become so dulled that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
worked mechanically and without initiative.
The happy days on the Waterloo Road seemed
now so dim and unreal that he scarcely
thought of them; only in the back of his
brain there was always an aching, hopeless
longing.</p>

<p>One midwinter morning at daybreak Pierrot
was aroused from restless slumber by a
great noise and confusion all about him. He
and Jef had been sleeping unharnessed
beneath their gun in a little hollow at the lip
of the trench, huddled close together for
warmth. In the night a light snow had fallen
and partly covered them.</p>

<p>Pierrot rose to his feet, stretched, shook
himself wearily, and stood blinking stupidly
out upon a white world. Across the trench,
a few hundred yards away, he could see the
helmets of a great host of Germans advancing
rapidly in solid ranks. The Belgian soldiers
were hurrying to the escarpment to meet the
attack, and already their rifles were speaking,
while German bullets ploughed sharp lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
in the snow or buried themselves in the bank
behind. Already one or two of the dogs who
were in exposed positions were yelping with
pain or had stiffened out upon the ground,
and now and then one of the carbineers went
tumbling down to the bottom of the trench.</p>

<p>The men in charge of the little battery
made a rush for their guns, and a few of
the dogs were hastily harnessed. Presently
Pierrot saw André Wyns come labouring
toward them with an armful of ammunition.
He had nearly reached them when he pitched
forward upon his face and rolled down the
bank.</p>

<p>Then came the Germans&mdash;hundreds, thousands
of them&mdash;not cheering, but pressing
grimly on and filling the gaps as their comrades
fell. There was a sharp order, and the Germans
broke into a run and stormed the trench
with fixed bayonets.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_078.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Then all was a frightful confusion of
struggling men. They filled the trench,
fighting desperately, and Belgians and Germans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
fell together in the awful agonies of
sudden death. The Belgians fought stubbornly,
but foot by foot the survivors were
forced back, and the Germans swarmed into
the trench, across the bodies of foe and comrade,
and up the opposite bank.</p>

<p>One or two of the carbineers had succeeded
in getting their machine-guns into action,
but they were soon overwhelmed and the
dogs who were harnessed were quickly bayonetted
that they might not run off with the
guns. Some of the other dogs fled and perhaps
a few escaped, but there was little chance
for them.</p>

<p>Pierrot and Jef stood waiting, the impulse
to flee not having come to them. Men
scrambled past them, but they stood dazed
and terrified. Then a big brute of a fellow,
his face distorted with the battle madness
which sometimes turns a man into a fiend,
came grunting and cursing up the bank, and
finding the dogs in his path, thrust his
bayonet wantonly through poor Jef&#8217;s heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Pierrot saw his team-mate fall without a cry.
The German put his foot on the animal and
drew out his bayonet with an effort. A spurt
of blood followed it and made a red pool in
the snow.</p>

<p>Unreasoning rage seized Pierrot, and with
what remained of his once agile strength he
leaped at the man&#8217;s throat and sank his fangs
into the flesh. The soldier dropped his rifle,
and grasping Pierrot in his strong hands
sought to choke him and force him off. But
the dog was crazed and blind with rage and
insensible to pain. He felt the tearing of
the man&#8217;s neck muscles between his jaws and
he tasted the hot blood. Then the man&#8217;s
grip relaxed and he fell backward. Pierrot
fell with him, the breath well-nigh gone out
of his body. But the man lay quiet, struggling
no more, and Pierrot extricated himself
and rose unsteadily.</p>

<p>The fight raging about him made no impression
on his stunned senses. But suddenly
another gray form appeared before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
him; a heavy boot caught him under the chin
and sent him sprawling. Then the report of
a rifle sounded loudly in his ears and he felt a
sharp and awful pain in his right hind leg.</p>

<p>After that, darkness.</p>

<hr class="chap" />






<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">V</h2></div>


<p>When the light again dawned upon Pierrot&#8217;s
distressed brain he was conscious, first,
of an intense sensation of pain and weakness.
Then gradually he became aware of a weight
upon his chest and a severe throbbing in his
right hind leg. He lifted his head but found
himself unable to move or to reach his wounded
leg with his tongue. Across his body rested
the heavy thigh of a dead soldier.</p>

<p>Pierrot sank back and waited till the dizziness
passed and his head cleared a little.
Then the universal instinct for self-preservation
and the need to struggle for his life
awoke within him. Little by little, with long,
painful waits between his efforts, he managed
to drag himself free from the weight upon him.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment, trembling with
weakness, as though to reassure himself that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
he was alive. All was quiet about him,
though the sounds of battle still raged not
far away. He hardly noticed the forms of
fallen men in the trench or heard their occasional
moans. Then he dropped to his
side again and made a feeble attempt to lick
his aching leg. The foot was quite numb
and the hair was matted and caked, but the
bleeding had stopped.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_083.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>As his small store of strength returned he
discovered that he was cold as well as weak,
and the need came upon him&mdash;the instinct of
the hurt animal&mdash;to crawl away to some
sheltered spot where he might either recuperate
or die. It seemed to him that first of all
he must get away from the horrible trench.
Very slowly and painfully, with one leg
dragging, he toiled up the bank and over the
escarpment, and lay panting on the snowy
ground. Then, after a little rest, he started
on again unsteadily toward a little thicket of
shrubbery that had been trampled nearly flat
by the feet of the grenadiers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>It seemed a long way off, and he was
obliged to stop often to rest. When at last
he approached the thicket he was startled for
a moment by a brown hare which scuttled
out from beneath the tangled bushes and
went bounding off across the snow. Pierrot
felt no impulse to give chase nor any wonder
that the hare should have escaped destruction.
He burrowed under the broken
branches and sniffed his way to where the
hare had made a nest in the dry grass beneath.
The spot was still warm, and Pierrot curled
himself up in it gratefully and fell to nursing
his wound.</p>

<p>For three days and two nights Pierrot lay
in his hiding-place, sleeping much of the time.
At noon the warm sun struck through the
twigs which by night shielded him from the
bitter winds. The Red Cross motors came
and there were sounds of human activity in
the trench. Soldiers marched by, but there
was no rushing attack and no heavily shod
phalanx came crashing through his cover.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
In his dense retreat he lay undiscovered, waiting
patiently for life or death.</p>

<p>During the third day he became restless
and slept but little. He was feeling somewhat
stronger and his mind had become
more active. His wounded leg throbbed less
severely. Toward nightfall an imperative
call came to him to go forth.</p>

<p>Thus far, strangely enough, he had not
felt keen pangs of hunger, for it is natural
for sick dogs to fast. But now he was painfully
aware of a consuming thirst. He had
occasionally reached out and lapped at the
cool snow outside his covert, but while that
had felt good to his fevered nose and mouth,
it had not sufficed. Now his throat was
parched, his tongue was thick and dry, and
his head ached. If you do not believe that
dogs have headaches, notice how your terrier
thrusts his head against your knee next time
he is ailing, and begs for the pressure of your
hand.</p>

<p>So Pierrot crawled out of his nest in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
gathering dusk and looked about him,
stretching his stiffened limbs and lifting his
nose to the keen wind. He walked once
around his thicket and then started off
across the frozen ground toward the dunes,
making laborious progress, keeping to the
shadows, sniffing for water.</p>

<p>Twice he heard voices, and once footsteps
approached and passed by, while he lay still
and waited, cowering. At last he came to a
hollow where melting snow had formed a
little pool. He broke the thin sheet of ice
with one forepaw, and then, thrusting his
nose into the freezing water, he drank long
and gratefully.</p>

<p>With the quenching of his thirst a new life
seemed to flow through his veins and courage
returned to his stout heart. But he was still
weak, and after a moment&#8217;s indecision he crept
back to his shelter.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth day he
awoke refreshed. But now a new need had
come to torment him. He was hungry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Sharp pangs gnawed at his vitals and all his
being cried aloud for food. He thrust his
head out of his hiding-place and looked about,
sniffing the air. Over the edge of the trench
he saw the movements of men and the sun
glistening on rifle barrels and German helmets.
He drew back stealthily. Experience had
taught him caution. He had had enough of
soldiers and of war. He must wait.</p>

<p>All day he suffered the agonies of hunger
and fought against the impulse to dash out
blindly in search of food. And as the day
advanced he was conscious of an ever-increasing
desire to go home. A great longing
filled him for his cozy bed in Medard&#8217;s
stable, for the home where there was always
plenty to eat, for the kind hands that knew
how to cure a dog&#8217;s hurts, for the human love
that had drifted so far into the past that it was
like a dream of heaven. The homing instinct
became his ruling motive; it obsessed him
and drew him as with chains.</p>

<p>Repeatedly he started impulsively out from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the thicket, and as often the sight of soldiers
drove him fearfully back.</p>

<p>When at last nightfall came and the
trenches glowed with little campfires, Pierrot
sallied forth, deliberately and cautiously.
First, he sought again his drinking-pool and
slaked his burning thirst. Then he passed
on into an unknown country in the dark.
He skirted the dunes, followed a little watercourse
for half a mile, and then struck into
a shallow ditch beside a rutty road. He
trusted little to his eyes, but ears and
nostrils were constantly alert to detect
danger, and he gave a wide berth to everything
that suggested man to his senses. His
sore feet had healed, but he was obliged to
travel on three legs by reason of his wound,
and he was still stiff and far from strong.
Always his nose was searching earth and air
for the scent of food.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped and lifted his head.
From a shallow ravine a few rods from the
road came a smell that at once attracted and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
repelled him. There was the scent of men
and of wood smoke. There was also the
scent of food. The thought of soldiers terrified
him, but his unwonted exercise had made
him ravenous with hunger.</p>

<p>Irresistibly the smell of food drew him, and
he crept stealthily toward the low bushes that
grew along the edge of the ravine. Peering
through, he saw with fearful eyes the glow of
dying campfires stretching off in a long line,
and the shadowy forms of prone men wrapped
in blankets. On the opposite bank a lone
guard paced slowly up and down.</p>

<p>Pierrot skulked silently along behind the
bushes till he came to a spot where the food
smell was very strong. Directly below him
was one of the smouldering fires, and a few
feet down the bank he discerned strewn about
half-visible objects from which the smell
came.</p>

<p>Grown reckless with famine, Pierrot
crawled eagerly out from the bushes and fell
upon the refuse of the camp. A hard crust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
of bread, the bones and offal of a fowl, the
beans clinging to the inside of a tin&mdash;he devoured
them all impartially.</p>

<p>One of the tin cans, dislodged by Pierrot&#8217;s
eager nose, rolled noisily down the bank, and
the sentry opposite halted and raised his rifle
quickly to his shoulder. Pierrot crouched
back, watching him. The soldier evidently
thought better of arousing his comrades with
a rifle shot, and suspecting that some animal
was prowling about, picked up a stone and
threw it at Pierrot. It struck with a thud
beside him and bounded up into the bushes.
Pierrot, thoroughly alarmed but still hungry,
seized a large bone in his teeth and dashed
back through the bushes. Not waiting to
ascertain whether he was pursued, he ran
for a mile across the frozen fields on his three
weary legs before he came to a stop. Then,
making sure that he had fully escaped the
danger that threatened, he fell upon his
stomach on the hard ground with the bone
between his paws, and spent a contented half-hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
crunching it until the last vestige had
disappeared.</p>

<p>When dawn began to show faintly in the
eastern sky Pierrot sought a new hiding-place.
At last he came upon the scattered
remains of a haycock in a marshy meadow.
The hay was damp and stiff with frost, but
Pierrot dug his way beneath the largest heap
of it and slept the deep sleep of exhaustion
until the evening fell.</p>

<p>When he awoke he was lame and sore, but
he dragged himself forth, yawned mightily,
and set his face toward home.</p>

<p>He felt not the slightest doubt as to the
general direction, but he had no idea of the
distance. There was but one thing to do&mdash;plod
doggedly along, with his right hind foot
held clear of the ground. Now and then he
made a detour to avoid suspicious forms, and
again to follow up a scent of food. Twice
that night he stumbled upon bits of refuse.
It was scanty foraging, but it served to appease
the pangs within him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>The next morning, having seen no soldiers,
and finding the country apparently peaceful,
he was emboldened to continue his journey
by daylight, for the longing for home was
strong within him. But the attempt was
too much for his weakened body, and he was
forced to give up before noon and crawl under
a hedge to rest.</p>

<p>At some time during the afternoon a
sound caused Pierrot to awake suddenly and
to leap to his feet. A human form and footstep
brought him to a quick posture of defence,
with bared teeth and bristling neck.</p>

<p>Before him stood a young woman in a
coarse gray dress, torn shawl, and wooden
shoes. She was not happy looking and pretty
like the newsgirls in Brussels, nor neat and
fresh-faced like Mère Marie. She was a squat,
dumpy sort of person, with a pale face and
dull eyes and her mouth was drawn down at
the corners.</p>

<p>At first she was as much startled as Pierrot,
and a look of fear overspread her coarse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
features that was not pretty to see. But
when she saw it was only a dog, the dull
look came back to her eyes and she stood
stolidly waiting.</p>

<p>Pierrot had never suffered ill at the hands
of a woman, and the snarl died in his throat.
The bristles on his neck lay down again and
his tail began to move tentatively. He took
an inquiring step toward the woman.</p>

<p>The ghost of a smile flitted across the
peasant&#8217;s face and she slowly approached
Pierrot with her thick palms outspread.
The dog advanced a little nearer, with a
cocking of the ears and a look of pleased
inquiry in his eyes. Then the woman perceived
that he was lame. Her slow sympathies
quickened and she approached and laid
her hand on his head. Then she stooped and
felt of his leg, not too gently. It hurt Pierrot,
but he only gave her ear a little caress with
his moist nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor fellow!&#8221; said the woman in Flemish.
&#8220;Come, and we will wash it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>Pierrot followed her as she walked toward
a little grove of trees back from the road and
entered the low doorway of a small hut.
There was no one inside except an old gray
cat, which at once retired to the rafters. At
this the woman gave a low, short laugh.</p>

<p>The hut was a poor little place, indeed,
and apparently the woman lived all alone in
it, though there was a man&#8217;s smock hanging
from a peg on the wall. She moved about
with a sort of hopeless indifference, hanging
a kettle of water in the chimney and building
a little fire of faggots beneath it. Pierrot lay
down before it and fell asleep again, for he
was still very weary.</p>

<p>When the water was warm the woman took
an old rag and washed Pierrot&#8217;s wound. He
awoke and thumped his tail on the hard
earthen floor, for the warm water felt very
good. Then the woman tied the rag about
his leg and bade him lie quiet.</p>

<p>Going to a cupboard, she brought out a
half loaf of coarse black bread and cut off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
two slices. Then she got a bowl and a little
meal and made a sort of broth or gruel.
These she placed on the rude table and drew
up a stool.</p>

<p>Pierrot did not move toward the table, but
lay watching the woman with interest as she
folded her hands and bowed her head.</p>

<p>Presently she began eating her broth with
a pewter spoon, but she did not finish it.
She placed the bowl on the floor and Pierrot,
not understanding how hungry she still was,
cleaned it in a twinkling. Then the woman
gave Pierrot one of the slices of bread and ate
the other herself. The gray cat, it appeared,
was expected to forage for his own dinner.</p>

<p>Pierrot stretched out before the fire again,
with a feeling of peace and contentment such
as he had not known for a long time, and
slept soundly for many hours.</p>

<p>In the morning the peasant woman gave
Pierrot half of her scanty breakfast. Then
she drew her worn shawl over her head and
opened the door of the hut.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Pierrot arose regretfully and went out into
the crisp morning. The woman turned off
toward the little wood, but Pierrot hesitated.
She had been very kind, but she was not
going in the direction of home. Not hearing
his footsteps, she turned and spoke again,
pleadingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>But still Pierrot hesitated. He was grateful
to the woman, and his first impulse was to
obey her, but from where he stood he could
see the long road stretching toward the east,
and he knew that off there somewhere were
home and the faces of those he loved. The
need to go on awoke again within him, and
with one little bark of farewell he turned and
hobbled rapidly off on his three legs. The
woman stood gazing after him for a few
moments, a pathetic object in the keen morning
wind. Then she brushed the back of her
hand across her eyes and turned slowly away
among the trees.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
It was no three days&#8217; journey that Pierrot
had undertaken this time, for though he had
no load dragging at his heels, he found that
he could not travel fast nor very far at a
time. He had only his instinct and a vague
memory to guide him, and often the winding
road led him astray, so that he covered many
needless miles.</p>

<p>But he had ceased to fear the soldiers, and
dared now to travel by daylight and thus
made better progress, though he still made
wide detours to avoid suspicious looking
people. The clumsy bandage became loose
and Pierrot tore it off with his teeth, but his
wounded leg did not hurt him now save when
he attempted to use it.</p>

<p>It was weary work, travelling on three
legs and on scanty rations. Sometimes he
was obliged to sink down exhausted in a sheltered
spot and wait till his strength returned.
Sometimes, when the pangs of hunger seized
him, he was forced to waste valuable hours
hunting for food.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_097.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>People in houses and peasants in the fields
he learned not to fear, and twice he was invited
into cottages and fed. But always he
managed to get away after he was rested and
never knew that he was guilty of ingratitude.
Sometimes men on the road or in the fields
called to him, but he would not stop. Once
a boy gave chase, but Pierrot put all the
speed he could muster into his three legs and
contrived to escape, though he was obliged to
lie panting for a long time after this race
before he could recover. It was hard for him
to understand this loss of his old-time power.</p>

<p>He kept no account of the days and only
knew that the way seemed endless. But one
afternoon the conviction seized him that he
was nearing his journey&#8217;s end. There was
nothing familiar in the objects in the landscape;
he had never been there before. But
something inside him told him it was so. He
pressed on eagerly, whining a little to himself
as a terrier whines when he scents a mole.
Surely, over the next hill, or around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
next bend, he would come upon the old, familiar
scenes&mdash;cottage and byre and the blessed
fields of home. Over there, just beyond, were
the well-remembered faces, the happy voices
of the children, the capable, kind hands of
Mère Marie.</p>

<p>In his zestful haste he overtaxed his
strength again, and, trembling with excitement
and fatigue, he was obliged to seek rest
before sunset.</p>

<p>He slept fitfully that night. Frequently
his dreams awoke him and he stood peering
into the darkness, listening for he knew not
what, before he remembered and lay down
again. But though he rested ill, he was abroad
before daybreak, padding laboriously on.</p>

<p>All that day he travelled without food or
rest, stopping only for an occasional drink
when opportunity offered. There was never
a doubt in his mind that to-day he would be
home again. No sound or scent or unaccustomed
sight lured him from his straight
course. Then at length he came out upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the road he knew, with its rows of poplar
trees, and his heart began to hammer at his
ribs. Heedless of pain and weariness, he
dashed blindly on, around the bend in the
road, up the little lane, to the place where
home had been.</p>

<p>Pierrot stopped in a panic of bewilderment.
The tile-roofed house was gone and
only blackened timbers remained. He
sniffed about among the ruins for a time,
greatly troubled, and then circled around
toward the outbuildings. They, too, were
gone, but nearby was a little shack that he
did not remember.</p>

<p>Night was coming on again, and Pierrot
was feeling very weary and forlorn and hopeless.
Was this, then, the empty end of his
long, painful quest? Where was the pretty
little home and the comfortable cow barn
and the people he used to love? Had all
vanished into thin air?</p>

<p>Pierrot dragged himself disconsolately over
to the strange little shack and sniffed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the crack under the door. Something in the
scent drove him into a sudden frenzy of excitement.
He began to scratch vigorously
and gave voice to one short, sharp bark.</p>

<p>After the Belgian soldier had marched
away with Pierrot, hard times fell upon the
little dairy farm of the Van Huyks. Soon
the Germans came and drove off their one
heifer, and there was no more milk or butter
for them. They also took all of the wheat
and most of the rye that was in the barn.
There was still a little wheat in the field that
Gran&#8217;père had not had time to bring in.
They all turned out and gleaned every grain
of this and Mère Marie hid it under the floor
of the house together with what little had
been left in the barn. All of their chickens
were taken, too, and there was not much left
for them to eat. The Germans were not
rough with them and gave them a paper in
payment for the things they had taken, but
this would not buy food.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>Mère Marie, fearing the German soldiers,
kept Henri and Lisa closely indoors, and she
herself seldom went far from home. Only
old Gran&#8217;père went out and got the news and
came back walking very proudly but with
never anything good to tell. The Germans
were still pressing on, but Gran&#8217;père did not
despair. The Belgians had fought bravely,
as Belgians should, and they would be delivered
out of the hands of the despoiler.
But Mère Marie was less hopeful. She very
seldom got any sort of news of Père Jean, and
so many women were mourning their dead
that she became very sad and frightened,
especially after she learned that Joseph Verbeeck
had been killed by a bursting shell. She
also heard other things from the lips of her
panic-stricken neighbours which made her
shudder and draw wee Lisa very close.</p>

<p>Again the Germans came a few weeks later
and searched the house and outbuildings for
anything they might find useful. They did
not discover Mère Marie&#8217;s little hoard, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
one of the soldiers, who seemed to be an officer,
became very angry and talked very loud,
though they could not understand him. When
he went out to the barn he broke down the
door with his foot, though Henri would have
shown him how to open it.</p>

<p>But one of the soldiers was not so unkind.
He stood apart, seeming to be standing guard
at the door, and when the officer swore he
appeared not to approve, though he said
nothing. He was a young Bavarian, with a
round, smooth-shaven face and eyes very far
apart, and with the heavy red hands of a peasant.
Something about him attracted little
Lisa, and when Mère Marie was occupied
with the other soldiers the child slipped out
unnoticed and went up to him.</p>

<p>Nobody had ever had occasion to instruct
wee Lisa as to the iniquity of staring, and she
stood now with frankly curious eyes gazing
full on the soldier&#8217;s broad face. He looked
almost like an overgrown toy as he stood
there so straight with his heels close together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and his round red face appearing so abruptly
above his gray coat with its shiny rows of
brass buttons. She hesitated to break
the spell that seemed to have turned this
ruddy man into a wooden image, but the
soldier could not long withstand her intent
scrutiny and gradually his face relaxed into
a smile.</p>

<p>It was a very pleasant smile and it gave
Lisa a warm feeling inside. It suddenly occurred
to her that this was the first genuine,
unforced smile she had seen for some time.
Surely these German soldiers weren&#8217;t such
terrible monsters, after all. Indeed, one could
easily learn to like this one.</p>

<p>Of course wee Lisa was not old enough to
know that if all Germans were Bavarian peasants,
and all Russians were Polish moujiks,
there would be no war at all.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_105.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Gran&#8217;père had complained sometimes of
being stiff in the joints, and Lisa wondered if
this soldier might not be suffering from an
acute attack of this affliction. She did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
know just how to put her question, so she
asked, in Flemish, &#8220;Do you bend?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lisa had a sweet little voice for one pitched
in so high a key, and it made the soldier smile
more broadly. He shook his head and uttered
some extraordinarily gruff words that
meant nothing to Lisa. She was satisfied
that he did not bend, though somewhat reassured
by the apparent mobility of his neck.</p>

<p>Her eye was attracted by a slight movement
of his right hand, which hung by his side, and
going quickly over to him she raised it and
discovered that his arm, at least, was quite
properly hung from the shoulder. Whereat
the soldier laughed aloud, but checked himself
very suddenly as his comrades and the officer
appeared from around the house. Then
Lisa heard her mother calling her, and hastened
in.</p>

<p>After a final inspection of the house the
officer called to the soldier in front and they
all started off across the fields toward
Madame Verbeeck&#8217;s house. As they passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the kitchen window bold little Lisa thrust her
head out, and the Bavarian soldier brushed
his lips across the top of her yellow head so
quickly that no one saw, not even the vigilant
officer nor anxious Mère Marie. Lisa called
a shrill good-bye after him and waved her
hand, but he marched straight ahead with the
others without turning back. Perhaps he
heard, though.</p>

<p>After the soldiers had failed to find the
grain under the floor, Mère Marie felt quite
safe, but she began to be worried about the
small quantity. No one seemed to know
how long the war would last. One said three
years; another believed the English would be
over in a few weeks, and then the Germans
would go flying back home; others declared
that, whatever happened, Belgium was
doomed, and the sooner the poor people left
the country the better.</p>

<p>Mère Marie did not know whom to believe,
but she decided that it would be only prudent
to husband her little store of grain so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
it would last all winter. She estimated the
amount on hand, and also the late cabbages
and turnips and everything else she could
count on for food, and divided the whole by
the number of winter days. When she discovered
how little that allowed for each day,
with nothing extra for Sundays, she began to
be frightened. She consulted Gran&#8217;père, and
he agreed that they should restrict themselves
to short rations.</p>

<p>Mère Marie explained this to the children
as best she could, but little Lisa did not understand
very well. So when she discovered
how very little she might have to eat, even
when she was most hungry, she would cry
sometimes. But Henri, who was nearly nine
years old now and had been learning much
about the doctrine of courage from Gran&#8217;père,
bore the deprivation without complaint
and even shared his last few morsels with
Lisa.</p>

<p>It would seem as though the Van Huyks
had suffered enough for one family, but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
you remember all the poor Belgian families
that had been left starving or had been
broken up or sent fleeing to strange lands or
wiped out altogether, when you recall what
happened about Aershot and Louvain, you
will see that the Van Huyks still had something
to be thankful for even when the worst
came. For they were still all alive and well;
even Père Jean had not yet been reported
among the dead or missing; while all Belgium
was lying prostrate beneath a load of want
and sorrow and horrible dread. For war is
cruel and winter is cruel, and the poor folk
of Flanders and Brabant were without
hope.</p>

<p>Late in October there came a banging of
rifle-butts on the door and again a group of
soldiers in green-blue overcoats invaded the
little tile-roofed cottage on the Waterloo
Road. They had been drinking and were
very rude and boisterous. They ransacked
the premises and cursed because they found
so little. One of them struck old Gran&#8217;père<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
across the face with the back of his hand and
another seized Mère Marie and, in spite of
her struggles, kissed her on the cheek. Worse
things might have befallen them had not one
of the soldiers, angered at the lack of loot, set
fire to the house and the barn.</p>

<p>As the flames started up, brisk and crackling,
the soldiers seemed to become suddenly
sobered and alarmed. Perhaps they were
not allowed to do such things. At any rate,
they set off up the road, leaving the little
homestead blazing behind them.</p>

<p>Mère Marie and Gran&#8217;père saved what
they could of their humble belongings, the
former working in a frenzy of grief, with the
tears rolling down her cheeks, while Gran&#8217;père&#8217;s
mild features were distorted by a look
of defiant hatred. Out in the garden Henri
and Lisa stood hand in hand, gazing in silent
awe upon the terrible spectacle.</p>

<p>That night they slept under Madame Verbeeck&#8217;s
roof, but she could not keep them;
she was afraid to. So the next morning they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
started back, sad and despairing, to the smoking
ruins of their home.</p>

<p>Out of such boards and tiles as he could
find, Gran&#8217;père, with Henri&#8217;s help, built a
little one-room shack near where the barn
had been, while Mère Marie sought among
the ruins for whatever of value might have
been spared. Some bedding they had rescued,
and Mère Marie found some pots and
pans and a few other things that could be
used. Her iron cook stove, too, though
cracked, still hung together. But the hoarded
grain and vegetables, alas! were burned and
ruined; there was scarcely a bushel left that
was fit for food.</p>

<p>Gran&#8217;père set up the stove in the shack and
built a rude table and benches and bunks.
He had a stout heart in his old breast, Gran&#8217;père
had, and though he didn&#8217;t talk much
he kept Mère Marie from breaking down.
Then they all set to work gathering dried
grass and weeds for their beds, and by nightfall
their poor little home was furnished.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>A few days later they heard again the
tramp of marching feet on the road, and
from their doorway watched a company of
German soldiers file past. Mère Marie was
not afraid of them now; it seemed to her that
they had done their worst. Gran&#8217;père stood
very erect and grim and silent, but wee Lisa
suddenly ran out with a glad little cry,
waving her arms. In the company she had
recognized her Bavarian friend. He turned
his head for a moment, but his face was expressionless,
and he did not leave the ranks.
So Lisa wept with disappointment.</p>

<p>But next day he came, quietly, after sundown.
He was alone and he knocked softly
before entering the shack. Without speaking
he laid a half loaf of rye bread on the
table and a small piece of bacon. Gran&#8217;père
looked very proud and angry and was all for
throwing them in his face, but Lisa ran up
to him joyfully, and he smiled a little as he
patted her head, so Gran&#8217;père allowed the
food to remain. Then the soldier looked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
Mère Marie with a very sad and tender expression
in his eyes and strode away in the
darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has little ones of his own,&#8221; said Mère
Marie.</p>

<p>Before long the weather grew very cold.
Gran&#8217;père mended a spade and banked up
the shack on all sides and put sods on the
roof. There was plenty of fuel among the
charred ruins of the house and outbuildings,
so that they were able to keep fairly comfortable
inside the shack, but all their warm
winter clothing had been burned and they
suffered from cold whenever they went out.
Their shoes, too, were getting thin and worn,
and all but one pair of Gran&#8217;père&#8217;s sabots
had been burned.</p>

<p>Worst of all, there was little or nothing to
do, and they had all been so industrious.
This was bad for Mère Marie especially, and
she took to brooding beside the stove and
thinking of Père Jean and all the happy days
gone by.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>As the winter drew on and the snow came
their life developed into a mere desperate
struggle against hunger and cold. Several
times Lisa&#8217;s Bavarian friend came stealthily
and brought food, but they never knew what
the next day might have in store for them.
Many of their neighbours had fled, but Gran&#8217;père
insisted on staying on their land, and
indeed they knew of no place whither they
might fly.</p>

<p>One day the young Bavarian came very
hurriedly and threw a sack of bread upon the
table. He could not explain where he had
got it; perhaps he had stolen it. But he
made them understand that he was ordered
away to the west and could not come any
more. They were all sad and troubled.
Then the soldier picked up little Lisa and
kissed her long and tenderly, and shook hands
with the rest. Even Gran&#8217;père did not refuse
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adieu,&#8221; said Mère Marie, &#8220;and God bless
you!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>&#8220;Adieu,&#8221; said the soldier in queer-sounding
French, and when he went out there were
tears in the honest blue eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has little ones at home,&#8221; said Mère
Marie again. &#8220;I hope he will get back to
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mère Marie took the bread and hid it and
estimated the smallest amount that would
keep body and soul together each day. Then
they all sat down and waited. There was
nothing else to do.</p>

<hr class="chap" />






<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">VII</h2></div>


<p>Every night and every morning Mère
Marie said her prayers to the Virgin, and at
last help came. A strange man who spoke
English visited the shack, took their names,
and made a note of their condition. Mère
Marie had learned a few words of English
from some of her customers in the Avenue
Louise, and she gathered that he was to bring
them something that had been sent in a big
ship by kind people from away across the sea
who had in some way heard of the plight of
Gran&#8217;père and Mère Marie and Henri and
wee Lisa. So they all waited anxiously for
his return.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_117.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>In a few days he came again in a motor
car and brought them a big box. He bade
them be of good courage and said that he
might bring more later. He was a very brisk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
businesslike sort of person, but not unkindly.
Then he hurried off again.</p>

<p>The family gathered closely around as
Gran&#8217;père opened the box, and very excitedly
they watched him take out flour, tea,
sugar, and clothing. Then Mère Marie fell
on her knees beside her bunk and buried her
head in her arms, and they all waited with
bowed heads while she sent up her thanks.</p>

<p>Then they began examining the clothing.
There was a gray fur coat for Mère Marie,
worn bare at the collar and wrists, but very
warm. There were shoes and stockings and
underclothes, a red jacket that could be cut
down for Lisa, and some cloth that could be
made into a coat for Henri. For Gran&#8217;père
there was a strange garment that he afterward
learned was a sweater. It was thick
and black and had a big green D on the front
of it. Gran&#8217;père did not understand the
meaning of the letter, but he found the garment
very warm.</p>



<p>Down in the bottom of the box there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
child&#8217;s book with the most wonderful pictures
of fairies and queer people all in bright
colours, and verses in a strange tongue; and
there was a roll of cotton bandages and some
medicines in bottles.</p>

<p>They were all quite overjoyed until Henri
said, &#8220;Now if only Père Jean would come
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mère Marie grew sober at that, and wee
Lisa added, &#8220;And big, shaggy old Pierrot.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was night by this time, and as they had
no lights Mère Marie said they must all go to
bed. But suddenly Henri&#8217;s sharp ears caught
a strange sound of sniffing and scratching at
the door. Then came a short, sharp bark.</p>

<p>Henri ran and opened the door, and there
stood good old Pierrot himself, very gaunt
and thin, but Pierrot!</p>

<p>Little Lisa ran and fell squarely upon him,
as she had been wont to do in the old, happy
days, and a little yelp of pain escaped him.
Gran&#8217;père pulled her gently away, and poor
old Pierrot did his best to leap gayly upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
them with little whines of delight, to show
how glad he was.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_119.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Yes, he was home again, back among the
loved faces and caressing hands that he had
dreamed about so long. He could hardly
contain himself for joy and nearly wagged
his stump tail off in his exuberance. Oh, if
he could only speak and tell them everything!</p>



<p>True, this was a strange little house; all the
surroundings were strange. But it was home
at last! For here were his people, his dear
people, and it is folks, after all, that count.</p>



<p>Gran&#8217;père understood dogs and knew that
Pierrot was hurt, so as soon as he could get
the dog and children quiet he brought Pierrot
out into the moonlight and examined him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pierrot has been a good soldier,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Then he sent Henri for the roll of bandages
and the bottles. So you see the kind people
across the sea must have heard of Pierrot, too.</p>



<p>&#8220;I fear he will always be lame,&#8221; said
Gran&#8217;père. But the children did not seem to
be greatly depressed by that. Neither did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Pierrot, for that matter, for after he had eaten
the crust of bread Mère Marie gave him,
and had kissed them again all around, he
stretched himself out on the edge of Henri&#8217;s
worn, scorched quilt with a great happy sigh,
and fell asleep, snoring loudly.</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
